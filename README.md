# string-similarity-evolver
This is a research project on the automatic generation of computer programs able to compute the similarity among two strings.
The generation is performed using Genetic Algorithms: the evolution is driven by a fitness functions which measures the degree to which a candidate program is able to separate two sets of strings: e.g., dates vs. non dates.

The project is in a very early stage.
